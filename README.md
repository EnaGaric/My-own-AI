I've decided to start a very demanding and ambitious (apparently I'm a masochist or a dreamer) project
In my opinion, we have started to evolve backwards. Nowadays, people use chatgpt or grok for anything, unbothered to even do a quick google search (by the way I HATE the google AI summary of something I typed in)
At this point, studying by using college materials, or even using wikipedia and endlessly searching for the right indian fellow on youtube has gotten....too hard for people?
Of course, it gets worse. I think we should classify this outcome as a new addiction called "AI dependency"
People panic when the servers are down because now they've forgot how to do basic tasks, such as baking a cake by reading the instructions on the box
As expected, that's not the worst part. People are using AI's for therapy, emotional support, friendship and even dating??????
I get it, we are prone to peronificating objects, such as instruments, plushies, anything that holds great value to us. I find this relatable, but also think of it as human nature. 
But marrying an AI or using it for...other purposes is out of the line
That is why I have decided to create my own AI, which will be made from sticks and rocks, independent from OpenAI or any quick tokens. I am interested in computational physics and clearly have a lot of time.
I am NOT creating another artificial companion such as clippy (perchance I might integrate it into my computer). The whole purpose of this project is simple. Learn and create.
I do not plan on creating this for marketing purposes and do not intend to make money off of it in the future. The most craziest thing I would try would would be giving it self awareness, curious for the results
I will not make it public, because I know exactly in which direction this invention will lead to. It will strictly be for scientific purposes, built brick by brick, fed with actual STEM data, including books, research etc
If you have made it to the end, I salute you, since you have just read 13 lines of absolute rambling. I will post cheat sheet files online for anyone who has a similar and ambitious idea. In that case, good luck, partners in crime!
